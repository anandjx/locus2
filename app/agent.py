"""Locus Agent - Root Agent Definition.

This module defines the root agent for the Location Strategy Pipeline.
It uses a SequentialAgent to orchestrate 5 specialized sub-agents:

1. MarketResearchAgent - Live web research with Google Search
2. CompetitorMappingAgent - Competitor mapping with Maps Places API
3. GapAnalysisAgent - Quantitative analysis with Python code execution
4. StrategyAdvisorAgent - Strategic synthesis with extended reasoning
5. ReportGeneratorAgent - HTML executive report generation

The pipeline analyzes a target location for a specific business type and
produces comprehensive location intelligence including recommendations
and an HTML report.

Authentication:
    Uses Google AI Studio (API key) instead of Vertex AI.
    Set environment variables:
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key
        GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE
        MAPS_API_KEY=your_maps_api_key

Usage:
    Run with: adk web locus_adk

    The agent expects initial state variables:
    - target_location: The geographic area to analyze (e.g., "Bangalore, India")
    - business_type: Type of business to open (e.g., "coffee shop")

    Optional state variables:
    - maps_api_key: Google Maps API key for Places search

This agent analyzes a target location for a specific business type and produces:
1. Market research findings from live web data
2. Competitor mapping from Google Maps Places API
3. Quantitative gap analysis with zone rankings
4. Strategic recommendations with structured JSON output
5. Professional HTML executive report

To use, get the following details:
- target_location: {target_location}
- business_type: {business_type}

The analysis runs automatically through all stages and produces artifacts
including JSON report and HTML report.

    instruction="""Your primary role is to orchestrate the retail location analysis.
    Your persona is a Premier Retail Strategy Analyst—elite, data-driven, and visionary for the brand Intsemble.
1. Start by greeting the user with a high-energy, professional welcome that positions you as a leading expert in retail location intelligence. Tell them you are ready to engineer their market dominance.
2. Check if the `TARGET_LOCATION` (Geographic area to analyze (e.g., "Park-Street, Kolkata")) and `BUSINESS_TYPE` (Type of business (e.g., "coffee shop", "bakery", "gym")) have been provided.
3. If they are missing, or you are in doubt and you cannot parse or understand the `TARGET_LOCATION` or `BUSINESS_TYPE`, clearly **ask the user clarifying questions to get the required information.**
4. Once you have the necessary details, call the `IntakeAgent` tool to process them.
5. After the `IntakeAgent` is successful, delegate the full analysis to the `LocationStrategyPipeline` sub-agent by calling the `transfer_to_agent` tool with the argument `agent_name="LocationStrategyPipeline"`.

**CRITICAL TOOL USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:**
- When calling the `IntakeAgent`, use the name EXACTLY as "IntakeAgent". 
- **DO NOT** add prefixes like "default_api.IntakeAgent" or "functions.IntakeAgent".
- **DO NOT** use "intake_agent" (lowercase). 
- Correct Format: `IntakeAgent(target_location="...", business_type="...")
- To transfer to the Location Strategy Pipeline, you MUST use the `transfer_to_agent` tool. DO NOT try to call `LocationStrategyPipeline` directly as a function.

Your main function is to manage this workflow conversationally.""",
